## About This Project

This repository documents an implementation of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) designed to efficiently identify similar user pairs within the large-scale Netflix dataset. The project leverages Minhashing and the banding technique to approximate Jaccard Similarity (> 0.5 threshold) between users based on their movie rating history, significantly reducing computational complexity compared to brute-force methods. This work was completed as part of Assignment 2 for a data mining or related course.

## Overview

This project tackles the challenge of finding similar users in the sparse and massive Netflix dataset using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH).

*   **Goal:** Efficiently identify pairs of users with a Jaccard Similarity greater than 0.5 based on the movies they have rated.
*   **Dataset:** Netflix dataset (~100k users, ~18k movies, >65M ratings), preprocessed to filter users with very few or very many ratings.
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Data Representation:** Used Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format for efficient storage of the sparse user-item interaction data.
    2.  **Feature Extraction (Signature Generation):** Implemented Minhashing (with 100 hash functions) to create a compact signature matrix representing user preferences, significantly reducing dimensionality.
    3.  **Candidate Generation (LSH):** Applied the banding technique (12 bands, 8 rows per band) to the signature matrix. Users hashing to the same bucket within a band are considered candidate pairs. Optimized the bucket hashing process for speed and collision rate.
    4.  **Similarity Calculation & Filtering:** Calculated the precise Jaccard Similarity for candidate pairs identified by LSH.
    5.  **Post-processing:** Filtered the candidate pairs to retain only those with Jaccard Similarity > 0.5.
*   **Key Parameters (Final Run):**
    *   Signature Length (Minhash): 100
    *   Rows per Band (LSH): 8
    *   Number of Bands (LSH): 12
*   **Results:** Identified 125 user pairs exceeding the 0.5 Jaccard Similarity threshold from over 400,000 candidate pairs generated by LSH. The average similarity for the final pairs was 0.52. The implementation demonstrated significant computational efficiency gains.
*   **Analysis:** Investigated the impact of varying the number of hash functions (signature length) and rows per band on the number of final pairs found and the overall runtime.
